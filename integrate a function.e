how to integrate a function from x to y:
	default steps be 100
	step size is the length of the interval, divided by the number of steps
	let the initial value of I be x
end

while i is smaller or less then y do
  evaluate the function at point I
  add the result to the sum
  increase I by the step size
done

finally return the sum divided by the number of steps

OK to have linebreaks??

   generating new language patterns on the fly, better than lisp macros!!
*/
let the initial value of i be x =Â» i=x
# ^^^ this is now a pattern!

default x be y -> x=y if x is not set
# ^^^ this is now a pattern!
